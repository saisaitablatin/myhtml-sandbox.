    <p> Suho Lee is an undergraduate student at MIT studying engineering. He was Jugyeong Lim's first love interest and
        was best friends with Seojun Han in middle school.
        Suho is described as "tall and foreign-looking," with dark, ash brown hair and light hazel eyes. Though
        considered very handsome by many, Suho often carries a stoic or cold expression on his face. He has a light,
        warm-toned complexion. Unlike Seojun, he does not bother styling his hair or dressing up other than on
        occasions. His clothes are all from high-end brands, as his father is a wealthy, famous actor. </p>

        has a pale skin tone. He is very handsome, often leading people to assume that he is a model, which he is.
        Seojun used to be an idol trainee with Seyeon Yoon, specializing in vocals. He met Seyeon and Suho Lee in middle
        school. They were great friends, nicknaming themselves as the "Three S's" as Suho supported Seyeon and Seojun's
        climb towards idol life. </p>
