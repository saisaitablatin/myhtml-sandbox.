    <h4>Coffee Menu</h4>
  </section>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Espresso</h4>
      <p>Espresso is the foundation of most specialty coffee drinks.
        It's a concentrated shot of coffee brewed by forcing hot, pressurized water through finely-ground coffee beans
        inside a small metal basket called a portafilter.</p>
      <span class="price">P250.00</span>
    </li>
    <li>Latte</li>
    <li>
      <h4>Cappuccino</h4>
      <p>A freshly pulled shot of espresso layered with steamed whole milk and thick rich foam to offer a luxurious
        velvety texture and complex aroma.</p>
      <span class="price">P200.00</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Flat White</h4>
      <p>A flat white is a coffee drink consisting of espresso with microfoam.
        It generally has a higher proportion of espresso to milk than a caffe latte, and a thinner layer of microfoam
        than a cappuccino.</p>
      <span class="price">P250.00</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Cold Brew</h4>
      <p>Cold Brew coffee is usually made by steeping coffee in water for a number of hours at cold or ambient
        temperature.</p>
      <span class="price">P240.00</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Iced Coffee</h4>
      <p>Iced Coffee is a cold version of your favorite coffee, but it's not simply a coffee that has been left to cool.
        Like a regular coffee, it's usually a combination of hot espresso and milk. However, iced is added to.</p>
      <span class="price">P195.00</span>

  </ul>

        on top.</p>
      <span class="price">P95.00</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Brownies</h4>
      <p>Brownies are a beloved dessert, a cross between a cake and a cookie, known for their dense, fudgy texture and
        rich chocolate flavor. </p>
      <span class="price">P200.00</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Croissant</h4>
      <p>A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, but mostly associated with France.
        Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a layered
        yeast-leavened dough.</p>
      <span class="price">299.00</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Scones</h4>
      <p>Scones are a delightful British baked treat, often enjoyed with tea.</p>
